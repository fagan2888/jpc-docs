# Submission Guidelines for the Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

- Do not include a separate title page. You will be prompted to input your title page information and abstract during the electronic submission process, which will then be formatted as introductory information that a reader will view before downloading the article in its entirety.
- All submissions must be in English. Except for common foreign words and phrases, the use of foreign words and phrases should be avoided.
- Page size should be 8.5 x 11- inches.
- Single space your text.
- Normal-sized fonts (10pt, 11pt, 12pt) should be used.
- You may include page numbers, but these will ultimately be changed to accommodate the numbering of the issue as a whole.
- Use a single column layout with both left and right margins justified.
- Use the following document structure (keeping in mind that there is no separate title page):
    - Title
    - Authors
    - Abstract
    - Keywords
    - Introduction
    - Subsequent sections and subsections that include tables, figures, and footnotes referenced in the text.
    - Supplementary material (Appendices) see below
    - References

## ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

- Abstracts should include a brief summary of the main research findings. Avoid generic statements such as "an example is presented". Instead, minimal details about examples should be included, as in, "we illustrate the benefit of our approach by analyzing data on employment from the UK Office of National Statistics".
- Please consider splitting papers into two distinct parts: a main manuscript and supplementary material. The main manuscript should be as succinct and readable as possible; the supplementary material can be any length (and in some cases may be unnecessary). The supplementary material may contain additional figures and tables, details about data, mathematical derivations, further explanations, or additional simulations or other supporting studies. The supplementary material should be placed after the main manuscript and before the references.
- Figures should be used to help with exposition. Where possible, one or more figures should provide illustrations of main results. These figures may be split into multiple parts. The legend on these figures should have enough detail that someone can get an impression of what is being displayed just by looking at the figure.
- Case studies should make sure to highlight both the main results for privacy and confidentiality from a practical perspective as well as the key methodological contributions in a form accessible to researchers coming to the topic from disciplines other than your own.
- Concluding summaries should be provided only in the context of giving additional perspective on the work.

## REFERENCES

It is the author's obligation to provide complete references with the necessary information. Our editors do not check this.

Within the references section, the citations can be formatted as you like, provided (i) the formatting is consistent and (ii) each citation begins with the last name of the first author.

## SUBMISSION FORMAT

- Submit your manuscript (including tables, figures, supplementary material, etc.) as a single file.
- All submissions should be as a PDF file. If your article is accepted, we will contact you to ask for a copy of the source file you used to create the article (preferably .tex).
- While LaTex is the preferred source format, Word and RTF files will be accepted as well.
