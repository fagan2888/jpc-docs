## The Quality Rating System

Different tiers within this journal correspond to different levels of general interest and the seminal nature of the publications. Articles in the Frontiers tier are those with the greatest general interest and, as the name suggests, those that are at the leading edge of the field. Articles in the Topics tier deal with issues of specific interest to a subset of scholars in the area of study and are less seminal in nature. The other tier(s) lie between (a full description of the quality rating system may be found here).

When an author submits an article for possible publication, he or she is actually submitting it simultaneously to all tiers of Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality (although it will appear in at most one of them). A submitted article is then assigned a single editor, who oversees the editorial process, and who ultimately decides whether the submission should be rejected, sent back for revisions, or accepted. If the editor chooses to accept the submission, then he or she decides in which of the tiers it would be most appropriate. The editorial decision is based on reviews of the submission by peers.

If the article is accepted into a tier of Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality, the author will be asked to send an electronic version of the article that conforms to bepress's formatting requirements. The author will also be required to agree to the publication agreement. If the author agrees, then the article will be published shortly after receipt of the final electronic version. Should the author not agree, then the article is considered withdrawn.

If the author is invited to revise and resubmit, then whether and when this is done is up to the author. The author can, at this stage, withdraw the article if he or she wishes.

## Who Can Submit?

Anyone may submit an original article to be considered for publication in Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality provided he or she owns the copyright to the work being submitted or is authorized by the copyright owner or owners to submit the article. Authors are the initial owners of the copyrights to their works (an exception in the non-academic world to this might exist if the authors have, as a condition of employment, agreed to transfer copyright to their employer).


## General Submission Rules

Every paper published in the JPC must be an original contribution unless prior arrangements have been made with the original copyright holder.

Papers that have previously appeared in a refereed conference volume can meet this requirement by making a significant enhancement to the conference paper. Authors will be asked to indicate the enhancements and reviewers will be asked to assess and confirm the enhancements.

Manuscript submissions should be a PDF file (Adobeâ€™s Portable Document Format), single spaced.


## Formatting Requirements

Please see Submission Guidelines for details pertaining to the formatting of articles upon initial submission. While we will accept Word and RTF files, we strongly recommend that you prepare your document with LaTeX in order to aid in the copyediting and final formatting of your document upon acceptance for publication. (If your article is accepted, we will contact you to ask for a copy of the source file (.tex) that you used to create the article.
