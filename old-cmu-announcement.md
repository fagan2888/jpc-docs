# Welcome to the Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality.

It was Steve Fienberg's wish that the Journal continue its activities, and the editorial team has been reassigning the roles previously so efficiently handled by Steve and Kira Bokalders at Carnegie Mellon University. We have been working on establishing a new website at http://www.journalprivacyconfidentiality.org.

# The new website is now open.

Please submit your manuscript at http://www.journalprivacyconfidentiality.org.

Should you encounter any difficulties, please contact the Editors at [editor@journalprivacyconfidentiality.org](mailto:editor@journalprivacyconfidentiality.org)  or Managing Editor Lars Vilhuber at [managing-editor@journalprivacyconfidentiality.org](managing-editor@journalprivacyconfidentiality.org).
