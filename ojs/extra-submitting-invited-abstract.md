# Procedure for invited abstracts

To allow editors to manage invited papers, the following procedure can be followed to collect abstracts without initial papers.

## PDF or Text Abstract
The abstract can be provided as a PDF document (optional), but it must also be provided as text amenable for copy-paste operations (LaTeX code acceptable).

## Submission
Submission initiates as any other submission, by starting the [regular submission workflow](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions). 

- Fill in the relevant information on the "Start" tab, including selecting the relevant section. Please note in the "Comments to Editor" who invited you to submit, and what conference or occassion is at the source of the invitation. **This is important for routing the submission!** Then click `Save and continue`
- On the "Upload submission",
  - (optionally) upload the PDF of the abstract
  - otherwise, cancel out of the dialog (`Cancel` or `x` in top corner), then click `Save and continue`
- On the "Metadata" tab, fill out the relevant information, including the Keywords.
- Finalize the submission.

## Post-submission
The issue editor can now  reject abstracts the same way s/he would regular papers. The final selection will be retained in the system.

## Obtaining the final documents
In order to initiate the next cycle of submission - the actual manuscript - the editor initiates the "Review" process, and then chooses "Resubmit for Review". The standard message is not appopriate and needs to be **manually** replace, a template message might be:

```
Congratulations! Your proposed manuscript has been accepted for inclusion in (SPECIAL ISSUE), subject to receiving acceptable reviews. 

Please submit your complete manuscript by (DATE) through the submission system.

Submission URL: {$submissionUrl}
Username: {$authorUsername}

If you have any questions, please contact me. Thank you for contributing to this special issue!
```

The document will appear to have gone through "Review 1" and will now be in "Review 2". The author is expected to submit the complete manuscript through the review process

## Obtaining reviews
Obtaining reviews proceeds as normally, except that the paper will appear to be in "Review 2".
