# Journal Policies

The Journal adheres to the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) [Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing](https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines-new/principles-transparency-and-best-practice-scholarly-publishing). In particular:

## Peer review process

All submissions are peer-reviewed; editorials and sundry materials are the exceptions, and are clearly marked. We rely on the volunteer effort by our peers for input. Every editor will seek at least two timely expert opinions for submissions. Peer review is single-blind: The authors' names are not blinded, the reviewers' names are kept confidential. The reviewer guidelines are [posted on our website](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/reviewer-guidelines). While we strive for quick turnaround, we do not control the time reviewers take to complete their tasks. The current turnaround goals are listed as part of the [reviewer guidelines](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/reviewer-guidelines).

## Ownership, management, and governance

The Journal is managed jointly by the [Editorial Team](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/editorialTeam), comprised of the Editor-in-Chief, the Managing Editor, and the other Editors. The Journal is fully independent, and is not owned by any university or publishing house. The Editorial Team has full control over the appointment of future editors, and the selection of referees. The Journal's contact information is available [on our website](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/contact). 

## Copyright and Licensing

The Journal's copyright policy is stated [on our Submission page](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions). Each article also identifies the specific license under which it was published. 

## Author fees

As of 2019, the Journal does not charge fees or charges for manuscript processing and/or publishing materials. This is clearly noted on the [Submission page](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions).

## Process for identification of and dealing with allegations of research misconduct

The Journal and its editors strongly discourage any attempt at plagiarism, citation manipulation, and data falsification/fabrication, among others. If we detect such behavior, or are made aware of any allegation of research misconduct relating to a published article in their journal, we shall follow [COPE’s guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines) in dealing with allegations. 

## Publication Ethics

### Journal policies on authorship and contributorship

The Journal requires that each author is aware of the contents of the entire article and its submission status, and each author materially contributed to the creation of the paper (see [Submission page](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions). The submitting author explicitly confirms this, on behalf of all authors, upon submission. 

### Complaints and appeals

Should authors have complaints about the behavior of any Journal editor, reviewer, or staff member, they should first attempt to contact the Managing Editor (see [Contact page](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/contact)). Should that not resolve the issue, the complainant may contact [COPE](https://publicationethics.org) or the Managing Editor's employer. 

### Journal policies on conflicts of interest / competing interests

Editors who have a conflict of interest with a submission recuse themselves from the editorial process. An alternate editor is then assigned. Editors may themselves be authors on submissions to the Journal, but are excluded from all aspects of the editorial workflow. 

Authors are encouraged, but not required to state any competing interests at the time of submission. 

### Journal policies on data sharing and reproducibility

The Journal strongly encourages transparency. The Journal’s [Code and Data Availability Policy](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/codedataavailabilitypolicy) is part of the [Submission Guidelines](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions).

### Other policies
The Journal does not have explicit policies on ethical oversight or on intellectual property.

### Options for post-publication discussions and corrections

The Journal does not host any forum for post-publication discussions. We may, subject to our Submission Guidelines, publish comments or discussions of articles published in the Journal. Authors may request corrections to their articles, which will be posted in addition to the original manuscript. Articles may be retracted, in which case a notice will replace the manuscript. 

## Publishing schedule

The Journal strives for two publications per year, dependent on submissions of sufficient quality. In addition, the Journal publishes special issues on certain topics, such as the [Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy (TPDP) workshops](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/tpdp). 

## Access

The Journal is Open Access. No fee is charged to view, download, or print articles. There is no print edition. The online edition has ISSN 2575-8527, and is available at the website [https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/). Readers may [subscribe to the Journal via a notification system](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/information/readers). 

## Archiving

The Journal is also archived on the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/index).
