# Reviewer Guidelines
*Provide reviewers with criteria for judging a submission's suitability for publication in the journal,
which may include instructions for preparing an effective and helpful review. Reviewers will have an opportunity to
provide comments intended for the author and editor, as well as separate comments only for the editor.*

See [public Reviewer Guidelines](/index.php/jpc/reviewer-guidelines).
