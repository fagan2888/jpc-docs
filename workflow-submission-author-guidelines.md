### License and Copyright 

Copyright is retained by the authors. By submitting to this journal, the author(s) license the article under the [Creative Commons License – Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), unless choosing a more lenient license (for instance, public domain). Furthermore, the authors of articles published by the journal grant the journal the right to store the articles in its databases for an unlimited period of time and to distribute and reproduce the articles electronically. 

### Formatting 

- The text should
  - be single-spaced;
  - use the same 10pt serif font (e.g. times) throughout;
  - use a single column layout with both left and right margins justified;
  - have letter page size (8.5 x 11 inches)
  - have 1 inch margins.
- Use the following document structure:
  - Title page, including Authors, Keywords
  - Abstract
  - Introduction
  - Subsequent sections and subsections that include tables, figures, and footnotes referenced in the text.
  - References
  - Supplementary material (Appendices) see below
- Abstracts should include a brief summary of the main research findings. Avoid generic statements such as "an example is presented". Instead, minimal details about examples should be included, as in, "we illustrate the benefit of our approach by analyzing data on employment from the UK Office of National Statistics".
- Citations can be formatted as you like, provided (i) the formatting is consistent and (ii) each citation begins with the last name of the first author.
- Please consider splitting papers into two distinct parts: a main manuscript and supplementary material. The main manuscript should be as succinct and readable as possible; the supplementary material can be any length (and in some cases may be unnecessary). The supplementary material may contain additional figures and tables, details about data, mathematical derivations, further explanations, or additional simulations or other supporting studies.  The supplementary material be formatted using the same stylesheet, and uploaded separately.
- The Journal strongly encourages transparency. Supplementary material, such as data sets, programming code and log files, should be available in an openly accessible repository. Authors should consult the [Journal's Code and Data Availability Policy](/index.php/jpc/management/codedataavailabilitypolicy).
- Figures should be used to help with exposition. Where possible, one or more figures should provide illustrations of main results. These figures may be split into multiple parts. The legend on these figures should have enough detail that someone can get an impression of what is being displayed just by looking at the figure.
- Case studies should make sure to highlight both the main results for privacy and confidentiality from a practical perspective as well as the key methodological contributions in a form accessible to researchers coming to the topic from disciplines other than your own.
- Concluding summaries should be provided only in the context of giving additional perspective on the work.
- While LaTex is the preferred source format, Word and RTF files will be accepted as well.

### ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
- Articles that are substantial enhancements of previously published peer-reviewed conference papers are acceptable. A copy of the previously published peer-reviewed conference paper or its digital object identifier should be provided on submission. The JPC will independently verify the originality of the submitted manuscript. Submissions of manuscripts that have been placed in online preprint repositories like arxiv.org and SSRN are allowed provided that they meet the other conditions in these guidelines.
- Authors are the initial owners of the copyrights to their works (an exception in the non-academic world to this might exist if the authors have, as a condition of employment, agreed to transfer copyright to their employer).
- Each author materially contributed to the creation of the paper.
