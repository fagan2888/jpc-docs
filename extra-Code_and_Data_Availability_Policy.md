# Code and Data Availability Policy

The Journal  requires authors to make all code and data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available
without restriction, with rare exceptions.

When submitting the manuscript, authors must provide a `Code and Data Availability Statement` describing compliance with this policy. The editors will assess the declarations made in the statement prior to publication. The Journal's editors encourage authors to contact them if they believe they will encounter difficulties in complying with the policy.

If the article is accepted for publication, the `Code and Data availability statement` will be published as a supplement to the final article. The Journal does NOT publish supplementary materials itself.

The Journal strongly encourages authors to also cite acceptable code and data repositories. In general, acceptable code and data repositories provide persistent identifiers, such as DOIs, and maintain robust long-term archives. Personal websites, links to subscription-based online storage facilities (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.), and online code repositories (Github, Bitbucket, etc.) are generally not acceptable, as they do not ensure persistence. We provide some guidance below.

This data policy was implemented on January 1, 2018. Any paper *submitted* before that date will not have a data availability statement.

## Required Information

* The `Code and Data Availability Statement` must specify where code and data are each permanently deposited, listing the *name(s) of repositories* along with *digital object identifiers* or accession numbers for the relevant data sets.

* The `Code and Data Availability Statement` must specify the conditions under which the deposited materials can be retrieved. A taxonomy is being developed, but a non-limiting list of possible options might be
    * access by download, possibly with (free) account creation and/or click-through license
    * access via a formal application process, specifying the conditions that an applicant may need to meet (nationality, membership in professional associations, security clearance, etc.).
    * for-fee access (purchase or subscription), stating the fee and conditions of use

* The `Code and Data Availability Statement` must specify the archival and curation policy of the institution curating the objects. For instance, the materials might remain accessible for 5 years, or "permanently".

## Guidance
* Repositories may be either subject-specific (where these exist) and accept specific types of structured data, or generalist repositories that accept multiple data types. We refer readers to the following sites and journals for guidance on appropriate repositories:

    * [PLOS One recommended repositories](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories)
    * [Nature recommended repositories](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories)
* We note that typical "code repositories" (Github, Gitlab) and cloud-based storage systems (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3) do not qualify as *permanent* repositories, as objects in them can be deleted or reorganized at any time, and may rely on subscription services to remain available.
* However, we also note that it is possible to link such repositories to formal archives. An example is  [Making Your Code Citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/). Alternatively, some repositories include within their workflow the ability to generate permanent archives with DOIs ([Open Science Framework](https://www.osf.io), [Figshare](https://www.figshare.com)).
