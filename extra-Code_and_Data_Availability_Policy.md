# Code and Data Availability Policy

The Journal  requires authors to make all code and data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available
without restriction, with rare exceptions.

When submitting the manuscript, authors must provide a `Code and Data Availability Statement` describing compliance with this policy. The editors will assess the declarations made in the statement prior to publication. The Journal's editors encourage authors to contact them if they believe they will encounter difficulties in complying with the policy. 

If the article is accepted for publication, the `Code and Data availability statement` will be published as a supplement to the final article. The Journal does NOT publish supplementary materials itself.

The Journal strongly encourages authors to cite acceptable code and data repositories. In general, acceptable code and data repositories provide persistent identifiers, such as DOIs, and maintain robust long-term archives. Personal websites, links to subscription-based online storage facilities (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.), and online code repositories (Github, Bitbucket, etc.) are generally not acceptable, as they do not ensure persistence. We provide some guidance below.

This data policy was implemented on January 1, 2018. Any paper *submitted* before that date will not have a data availability statement.

## Required Information

The Data Availability Statement must specify that data are deposited publicly and list the name(s) of repositories along with digital object identifiers or accession numbers for the relevant data sets. Read more about accession numbers. 


## Guidance
All data and related metadata underlying the findings reported in a submitted manuscript should be deposited in an appropriate public repository. Repositories may be either subject-specific (where these exist) and accept specific types of structured data, or generalist repositories that accept multiple data types. We refer readers to the following sites and journals for guidance on appropriate repositories:
