Raj Chetty and John Friedman are publishing an expanded version of an AEA P&P article in the Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality. Both John and Raj signed the "implicit consent" part of the P&P agreement, which requests notification of the AEA in the case of such a publication. The following text will appear in a footnote on the title page:

A shorter, earlier version of this manuscript was published
in the \textit{American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings} as
\cite{10.1257/pandp.20191109}. That version is Copyright, American Economic
Association; sections that overlap are reproduced with permission.

The expanded article will appear as

when Disclosing Statistics Based on Small Samples.” Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality
